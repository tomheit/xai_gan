mnist_cnn/m3_150Epochs used as classifier
mnist_wgan/wGan_1000_epochs used as gan
### tests

testExplainerV2Class.py performs gradient descent on images and displays them in a grid.
makeSingleDiffImage.py performs gradient descent on a single image and creates the difference image.
shapExplanation.py comparison with explanations generated by SHAP.
limeExplanation.py comparison with explanations generated by LIME.
### natural_adv
